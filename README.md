# Ridge Regression From Scratch

We implememnt the Ridge regression model from scratch using Python and only numpy, pandas.
In the end we compare the sklearn implementation to ours.

The point of this project is not to fit the model well by tuning the alpha value or preprocessing the dataset much. The point is to implement it from scratch and get a better understanding of the model this way.
